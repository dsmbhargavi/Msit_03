      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>As I was gratuated my B.TECH in Civil Engineering but I din't find any difficulty in pursuing MSIT </p>
      <p>MSIT program played a big part in shaping my ideology. <strong>'Learning by doing'</strong> methodology is showed me the right way to solve real-life problems.MSIT also employs a unique <strong>‘Sequential Learning’</strong> technique by which a student can master in that course and move to preceding courses.This technique is totally against the conventional  programs which offer courses in a parallel fashion. This sequential pattern had enable me to master one course a time, understand the relevant concepts, gave me some scope to explore in depth into core concepts and move on with the next course. I think this may help everyone to excel in IT field.
      The course is divided into modules, and each course has a Project. We work in team as same atmosphere of corporate. And also we have deadlines to submit our modules and project</p>
